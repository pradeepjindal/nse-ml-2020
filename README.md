# nse-ml-2020
machine learning project to predict direction of share market on nse, nifty stocks

market stats for 2021,
7 percent gdp,
15 percent absolute return yty,
30 pecent fluctuation,
now determine the lowest and highest point ?


create a correlation of nifty and sbin (nifty and icici)
for each level of nifty what is the price of sbin


premium atp = cash atp - future atp


rule: vwap atp (intraday)
do not sale if price is above vwap, it wud go up
do not buy if price is below vwap, it wud go down
it can be tested in intraday, if price stays over/below vwap, take action accordingly


if rsi comes above 70 on monthly then the stock price became 2x within a year

log chart give price in percentage

add vwap column to the report

price always follow higher time frame, month precedes, week, week precedes day
higher time frame tells the big and smaller time frame confirms it
to enter into trade the smaller trend must also confirm the same direction as big tf otherwise it is conflict

consecutive low detection

=========================
power of 2
if u want to trade hourly then keep the reference of last two days - high and low
if u want to trade day basis then keep the reference of last two weeks - high and low
if u want to trade week basis then keep the reference of last two months - high and low

for investing, weekly scale is right as daily is chaotic
on monday, market is open by rookie but it is closed on friday by pension fund
by law pension fund deals with etf only

monthly expiry date is best as SIP date


? if day ke last 5 minute mai, red candle hai...
is it means that day trader were long but there is no buyer and exchange force them to throw stock on lower price
? if day ke last 5 minute mai, green candle hai...
is it means day trader were short but there is no seller and exchange force them to cover stock on higher price

=======================================================================================================================
atp down, delivery up = bearish (flood of supply running down the price, lower and lower)
atp down, delivery dn = strong bear
atp up, del up = price rise would continue
atp up, del dn = price hitting its roof

==========================================
never approach bull from front
never approach horse from behind
and never approach an idiot from anywhere
